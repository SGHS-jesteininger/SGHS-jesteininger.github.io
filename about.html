			<p> Invercargill, or in Māori Waihōpa, is the southernmost and westernmost city in New Zealand, and one of the southernmost cities in the world. It is the commercial centre of the Southland region which lies in the heart of the wide expanse of the Southland Plains on the Oreti or New River. It sits amid rich farmland that is bordered by large areas of conservation land and marine reserves, including Fiordland National Park covering the south-west corner of the South Island and the Catlins coastal region. -

                The Burt family originated from a provincial town in England were they owned an inn called The Ducklin'. However, their youngest son Robert, found the small-town life slow and hoped that through travelling would find an exciting place of his own. After some time Robert came to New Zealand and visted Invercargill where he would meet and soon marry Margaret Ester - who was working as a receptionist at the time. Robert than began exploring Invercargill's bush walks until he came across Sandy Point - a place he immediately felt connected too. In 1999, after many debates, he and his wife established Sandy Point Hotel. Since then, many have joined their team as their exciting hotel grew, but also have grown their personal family of Louis, Madalin and Jamie.
